# Maniac Mansion Mania Episode 40: Trapped in the Cellar

![Screenshot-Episode-40](https://maniac-mansion-mania.com/images/stories/episoden/episoden/e40.png)

This is my very first self-developed point-and-click adventure game from 2006, which I developed with AGS 2.62 by Chris Jones. 
Although I knew very little about game development at the age of 15, I was able to make my first steps with AGS by the help of 
the Adventure-Treff Forum and the Maniac Mansion Mania Community. 
Because of the mediocre ratings and the bad puzzle design I developed in December 2006 an improved version with better puzzle design and a lot of humor. 
My game is not only the first episode of the Maniac Mansion Mania series with Razor as playable character, 
but also the first MMM episode available in six languages: English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese and Italian. 

You can download the compiled and playable version here:

Now my first adventure game is open source and feel free to take a look in it. 
Keep in mind I was about 16 when I last modified the programming code. Today, I have improved my programming skills. 

Important: On today's operating systems, especially Windows 10, you will probably have difficulties getting the game to run. 
You can ask questions in the Maniac Mansion Mania Forum here: https://www.maniac-mansion-mania.de/forum/index.php 

Don't worry, if you don't anything in German, you have also the possibility to write in English the international subforum. 
Our community has even fans outside of Germany, like in Italy and Argentina. 

Thanks for Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick for writing and designing the awesome Maniac Mansion. 
I also would like to thank David Fox, Aric Wilmunder, Chris Grigg, David Lawrence, Dave Warhol, David Hayes, Carl Mey, Brian Hales, Ron Baldwin, Jenny Sward, Dave Grossman, Tim Schafer, David Stifel, Harrison Fong, Mike Ebert, Noah Falstein and Boris Schneider-Johne.

Thanks to LucasFan for creating the fan adventure based Maniac Mansion Mania series. 

I would like to thank the Maniac Mansion Mania Community for allowing me to fulfill my childhood dream 
creating my very first adventure game and Chris Jones for Adventure Game Studio.

Have fun! :)
